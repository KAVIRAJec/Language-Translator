# Language-Translator

* A regional language translator using Python is a program that enables translation between two or more languages, with at least one of the languages being a regional language. The program leverages various Python libraries and APIs to accomplish this task.

* The first step in building a regional language translator using Python is to identify the input and output languages. The next step is to use a speech recognition library or API to detect and recognize the words spoken in the regional language. The recognized words can then be translated into the desired output language using a translation library or API.

* Libraries and APIs that can be used to build a regional language translator in Python using Neural Machine Translation(NMT) algorithm. These libraries and APIs provide a variety of functions, including speech recognition, language detection, and translation.

* Overall, building a regional language translator using Python is a challenging but rewarding project that can greatly benefit those who speak regional languages and want to communicate with people who speak other languages.

* It contains Text-to-Speech , Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Text conversion.

* We designed it using Python for backend and HTML, CSS for frontend.
